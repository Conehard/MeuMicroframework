# MeuMicroframework

"MeuMicroframework" was created to be able to create small APIs with few files and in a simplified way.

Done:
- Routing with middleware support
- Simple dependency injection
- Database communication (Tested with MySQL only)
- Migration framework (Can be executed via the /migrate route, remember to protect the route with AuthorizationMiddleware however you prefer.)

To do:
- Improve routing for multiparameters
- Implement JWT in a simple way
- Allow use with other databases
- Create CLI to create a structure of Controllers, Services, Repositories faster.
- Implement tests
- Implement debugger
